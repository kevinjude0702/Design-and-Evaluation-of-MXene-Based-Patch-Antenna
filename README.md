# Design-and-Evaluation-of-MXene-Based-Patch-Antenna

This paper presents a novel antenna design for 
strain-sensing applications operating at 3.5 GHz. The proposed 
antenna design is based on a conventional circular patch 
antenna using a polyimide substrate having dielectric constant 
of 3.5 and thickness of 0.1 mm. The overall dimension of the 
antenna is 30 x 28 x 0.1 mm3
